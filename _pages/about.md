Hi there! I'm Xijia Tao (Ciel, or 陶熙佳).

I recently graduated from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) with a major in Computer Science. This fall, I will embark on a new academic journey by starting a PhD. I don’t have a definitive research plan for my PhD yet, as the fast-paced nature of this field makes it challenging to pinpoint the most promising areas. However, I am open to opportunities and willing to experiment to identify the most impactful research topics in the long run.

Currently, I'm an intern at Zhipu AI, deeply immersed in the fascinating world of large language models (LLMs) and AI research. In my previous roles, I worked as a research assistant in the [HKU NLP Group](https://hkunlp.github.io/) under the guidance of [Prof. Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). My focus has been on NLP, particularly the applications of LLMs in formal theorem proving and exploring safety issues in vision-language models (VLMs).

Outside the tech bubble, I am a huge fan of cats and enjoy diving into various games. Feel free to join me in this exciting adventure as I continue exploring the realms of AI and beyond!
