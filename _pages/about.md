Hello there! I am Xijia Tao (Ciel, or 陶熙佳), a 3rd-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science (CS) at the University of Hong Kong. Currently, I am a research assistant working in [HKU NLP Group](https://hkunlp.github.io/). I am grateful for receiving supervision from [Prof. Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). 

My recent endeavour is NLP, more specifically the applications of large language models (LLMs). In the past, I have taken up the role of research assistant in other labs at the university. As an intern from the summer internship scheme organized by the CS department, I conducted research in physics simulation within the computer graphics lab. In addition, I have provided programming assistance to non-CS labs.
