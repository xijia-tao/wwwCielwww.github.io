Hello, I'm Xijia. Because I'm too lazy to write an introduction page for the time being, I used the following prompt in the New Bing to generate this page (except this exact paragraph). 

> introduction page of my personal blog website. I'm a computer science undergraduate. I am working in NLP and looking forward to a transition to other related disciplines.

# Welcome to my personal blog!

Hello everyone! My name is User B and I am a computer science undergraduate. I am passionate about natural language processing (NLP) and its applications in various domains. In this blog, I will share my thoughts, insights and experiences related to NLP and other related disciplines.

## A little bit about me

I have been interested in NLP since I was in high school. I was fascinated by how computers can understand and generate natural language, such as speech recognition, machine translation and text summarization. I decided to pursue computer science as my major in college and took several courses on NLP, such as computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language generation.

I have also participated in some research projects on NLP during my undergraduate studies. For example, I worked on developing a sentiment analysis system for social media posts using deep learning techniques. I also contributed to building a question answering system for medical domain using knowledge graphs and neural networks.

## What I am working on now

Currently, I am working on my senior thesis project on NLP. The topic of my project is "Improving Text Simplification with Semantic Parsing". Text simplification is the task of rewriting a complex text into a simpler one that preserves the meaning and readability. Semantic parsing is the task of converting a natural language sentence into a logical form that captures its meaning.

My goal is to use semantic parsing to improve the quality and diversity of text simplification outputs. I plan to use a neural semantic parser to generate multiple logical forms for each complex sentence and then use a neural text generator to produce multiple simplified sentences from each logical form. This way, I hope to achieve more accurate and varied simplifications that can suit different needs and preferences of the users.

## What I am looking forward to

After graduating from college, I plan to continue my education and pursue a master's degree or a PhD in computer science or related fields. I am interested in exploring other areas of NLP besides text simplification, such as dialogue systems, natural language inference and multimodal NLP. 

I am also curious about how NLP can be integrated with other disciplines, such as psychology, sociology and education. For example, how can NLP help understand human cognition and behavior? How can NLP enhance social interaction and communication? How can NLP support learning and teaching?

I believe that NLP has a lot of potential to make positive impacts on society and humanity. That's why I want to keep learning and researching in this field.

## What you can expect from this blog

In this blog, you can expect me to write about various topics related to NLP and other related disciplines. Some examples are:

- My opinions on recent trends and developments in NLP
- My reviews on papers or books that I find interesting or useful
- My reflections on challenges or lessons learned from my projects or courses
- My tips or advice on how to learn or do research in NLP
- My personal stories or anecdotes that relate to NLP

I hope that you will find this blog informative, engaging and inspiring. If you have any comments, questions or suggestions for me, please feel free to leave them below or contact me via email.

Thank you for reading this introduction page of my personal blog website! Stay tuned for more posts!
