This is where I take notes when learning Japanese. Sources are acknowledged in the beginning.

## Day 1^

- Japanese is a 'mora-timed' language; syllables are pronounced equally.
- Japanese characters can represent a vowel, a consonant and a vowel or a single consonant sound. 
- Word order: subject, object, verb, or SOV
- topic-prominent language
  - topic is the focus; usually omits the subject
  - create basic sentences; object + verb
- 3 different scripts used to write Japanese
  - Hiragana ひらがな is used to write functional words and particles.
  - Katakana カタカナ is used to write foreign words and names.
  - Kanji 漢字 is used to write native Japanese words, or words of Chinese origin.

## Day 2^

> Note: for writing Japanese on a PC, you can download Google Japanese IME, which can be more convenient than the Windows native IME. You can shift between Japanese and English with `Alt` + `~`.

**ありがとう** arigato1 - thank you

**すみません** sumimasen - I'm sorry/excuse me

**どこですか** - where is ...? Put place name before the phrase, e.g. 駅はどこですか？ホテルはどこですか？コンビニどこですか？

> Why is は (ha) sometimes read as わ (wa)? 
> 
> は is only pronounced as wa when being used as topic marking particle or the end of a phrase, e.g. こんばんは (good evening), こんにちは (hello). But for instance, はる (春) is pronounced as haru.

The timing of each syllable is important. Syllables pronouncing with different time can have different meanings, e.g. おばあさん (grandma) and おばさん (aunt). To achieve the necessary pause, use a pause (つ) between syllables, e.g. きつて (stamp) and きて (please come).

Pitch accent (intonation) can also lead to words with different meanings, e.g. は2し1 (chopsticks) and 橋 (ha1shi2, bridge).

## Day 3

Past tense: ました、ませんでした

Present/future tense: ます、ません

を can be used after the subject as a word proceeding quantitative term, e.g. りんごを２つ食べます

be going to: に行きます

(not) a lot should be put before the walk, e.g. 彼女はあまり踊りません

Verbs (時々、いつも、よく) representing frequencies need not は、お、を after them when put in front of a sentence, e.g. 私はいつもスポーツが大好きです。私はいつも彼を愛します (strange, the particles after `sports` and `him` are different, should investigate later, [video](https://youtu.be/UaI7UpOl-Xk) to-watch on Japanese particles)

は indicates the relationship with the subject, while が somehow decorates the subject.

[x]から: from [x] 　[x]まで: to [x]

どれくらいかかりますか？: how long will it take?

駅からホテルまで車で五分くらいかかります: it takes about 5 minutes to go from the train station to the hotel by car.

### Negative い-Adjectives*

When い-adjectives are switched from positive to negative, they undergo a spelling change. The characteristic い-ending switches to a く、and the phrase meaning "not" is added to the end. The final result is an ending such as くないです。See the example below.

| Sentence         | Translation                |
|:---------------- |:-------------------------- |
| これはおいしいです。       | This is delicious.         |
| これは**おいしくないです**。 | This is **not delicious**. |

Just like with positive い-adjectives, all negative い-adjectives can drop the です ending in casual speech.

| Sentence       | Translation                |
|:-------------- |:-------------------------- |
| これは**おいしくない**。 | This is **not delicious**. |

To make the speech more formal, one can change the ending from くないです to くありません。

| Sentence          | Translation                |
|:----------------- |:-------------------------- |
| これは**おいしくありません**。 | This is **not delicious**. |

近くも遠くもないです: it is neither near nor far.

## Day 4

### Difference between これ、それ、あれ

- for objects in the vicinity: これ
- for objects unknown to the audience: それ
- else: あれ

### Wearing Clothing*

Japanese has many translations for the English words "to wear" or "to put on," depending on where on the body the clothes are worn. Below are some examples taught in this lesson.

| Japanese   | Notes                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 着ます・きます    | **wear**, on the whole body or upper body |
| 被ります・かぶります | **wear**, on the head                     |
| 履きます・はきます  | **wear**, on the lower body               |

### Together!*

In Japanese, there are different ways to ask someone to do something with you. Your verb ending can subtly change the nature of your request or suggestion.

| Verb Ending | Meaning in English                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ~ませんか       | "Would you like to...?" / "Do you want to...?" |
| ~ましょう       | "Let's..."                                     |
| ~ましょうか？     | "Shall we...?" / "Should we...?"               |

| Japanese         | English                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| プールで泳ぎ**ませんか**？  | **Would you like to** swim at the pool? |
| プールで泳ぎ**ましょう**。  | **Let's** swim at the pool.             |
| プールで泳ぎ**ましょうか**？ | **Shall we** swim at the pool?          |

#### Weeks and Months

Japanese has specific words for ideas like "last week," "next week" and "this week." There is even a word for "the week after next"! Maybe you'll notice a pattern with how these words are formed!

| Word | Reading | Meaning    |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| 今月   | こんげつ    | this month |
| 来月   | らいげつ    | next month |
| 先月   | せんげつ    | last month |

| Word | Reading | Meaning             |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------- |
| 今週   | こんしゅう   | this week           |
| 来週   | らいしゅう   | next week           |
| 先週   | せんしゅう   | last week           |
| 再来週  | さらいしゅう  | the week after next |

#### Playing an Instrument

Japanese uses different verbs to talk about playing different kinds of musical instruments. In this skill, you will encounter the verb used for playing a string instrument - **弾きます** (ひきます). Don't forget that the piano is included as a string instrument!

| Japanese      | English                |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| ピアノを**弾きます**。 | I **play** the piano.  |
| ギターを**弾きます**。 | I **play** the guitar. |

## Day 5*

#### Isn't it?

In Japanese, it is common to ask a question in the negative form in order to solicit agreement. These sentences are commonly translated as "Isn't it...?" in English.

| Japanese             | English            |
| :------------------- | :----------------- |
| 暗い**ですか**？     | **Is it** dark?    |
| 暗く**ないですか**？ | **Isn't it** dark? |

Did you notice the difference? When the question is asked with a regular adjective form, the English meaning is "**Is it...?**" When it is asked with an adjective in the negative form, the English translation changes to "**Isn't it...?**"

#### Adverbs

In Japanese, you can change an -い adjective to an adverb by dropping the **-い** and replacing it with **-く**. Adverbs are usually words that end in **-ly** in English and describe *how* something happens.

| Adjective     | Meaning | Adverb        | Meaning  |
| :------------ | :------ | :------------ | :------- |
| 強い (つよい) | strong  | 強く (つよく) | strongly |
| 弱い (よわい) | weak    | 弱く (よわく) | weakly   |

Here are some examples of how these different forms are used.

| Japanese               | English                      |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| 風が**強い**です。     | The wind is **strong**.      |
| **強い**風がふきます。 | A **strong** wind blows.     |
| 風が**強く**ふきます。 | The wind blows **strongly**. |

### Very, quite, or not at all!

In this skill, you will encounter words that can modify the severity of your sentences. 

**全然 (ぜんぜん)** and **全く (まったく)** can both be used with negative sentences to mean "not at all."

| Japanese                             | English                                            |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| この野菜は**全然**おいしくないです。 | These vegetables are **not** delicious **at all**. |
| 牛乳は**まったく**多くないです。     | There is **not** much milk **at all**.             |

**とても** and **大変 (たいへん)** can both be used in affirmative sentences to mean "very."

| Japanese                               | English                       |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| このラーメンは**とても**おいしいです。 | This ramen is **very** tasty. |
| **大変**おいしいです。                 | It is **very** tasty.         |

**結構 (けっこう)** can be used in affirmative sentences to mean "quite."

| Japanese                 | English                                        |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| 塩が**結構**多いですね。 | There is **quite** a lot of salt, isn't there? |

#### A Small Amount

**少ない (すくない)** is an adjective that means “few” or “not much.” Be careful – although the word ends in -ない, it isn’t the negative form of the adjective! The negative form of 少ない is actually 少なくない (すくなくない). That’s a mouthful!

| Japanese                 | English                      |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| カレーが**少ないです**。 | There is **not much** curry. |

## Day 6

### Difference between を and お[!](https://www.italki.com/post/question-136705?hl=ja)[!](https://www.reddit.com/r/japanese/comments/jx9csx/the_difference_between_%E3%81%8A_and_%E3%82%92/)

を is a particle for direct objects, and is used as just that. Maybe in historical hiragana, を may be used (such as 男, which has the historical reading of [をとこ]. Otherwise, it isn't ever used in the pronunciation of any modern Japanese word, mainly because the Japanese got to a point where the "w" in "wo" (That's the more accurate romanization of the kana) was not able to be pronounced.  

私はテレビを見て居ます。[わたしはテレビを見ています。] translates into "I am watching TV." を is the direct object marker, proceeding テレビ, thus defining what the action (見て居ます) was directed towards, which was the television. It can also be used to indicate the moving out of a place (contrast with に), or the moving through a place. Example: 

- 公園を出ます。（こえんをでます。）means "(I) exited out of the park", or alternatively "(I) left the park."  

- 公園を歩きました。（こうえんをあるきました。）means, "I walked through the park." 

On the other hand, "o" or "go" (お/ご, respectively), is used as an honorific for words. There are words that are embellished when the prefix is used (ex. おすし), and then there are words that NEED to be embellished (ex. おもちゃ, which means toy). I believe these are also the words that CAN go unembellished, but would otherwise make you sound ill-bred, rude, or even a drunkard (お金 「おかね」 is ALWAYS usually said as just that, not just 「金｣). Then, you have words whose meanings CHANGE when the prefix is used (ex. [お中] means "stomach", while [中] by itself means "middle" or "center".）を is ALWAYS used as a particle, and therefore it's katakana equivalent ヲ is seldom used. Except for certain instances, お and ご are optional and primarily embellish words that you sound more polite/formal/humble. Those two aforementioned kana will NEVER be used as particles.

---

The hiragana character を originally represented the sound 'wo', however the pronunciation in modern Japanese has almost entirely dropped the 'w' part and now sounds basically like 'o'. Most Japanese speakers will use this pronunciation most of the time, so if you're just starting out it's safe to always go with this pronunciation. This character is almost exclusively used as a particle in modern Japanese (that is, it goes after a word to show that the word is the object of a verb).

As you get more proficient in listening you might notice that occasionally people pronounce it with that 'w' sound (although it's a little different than an English 'w' sound). The most common times to hear it are in songs or speeches, or other occasions when people are trying to enunciate extremely clearly or differently from everyday speech. There are also some people who just pronounce it that way all the time, and some who pronounce it that way some of the time.

The difference between は and を is that the pronunciation of は depends on it's function in the sentence. The 'wa' pronunciation is used when it is a particle (marking the topic of the sentence) and the 'ha' pronunciation is used when it is just a regular part of a word, for example in 花 (はな), meaning flower. を's pronunciation doesn't really change, but when it does it depends on the occasion or person, rather than the part of speech. を is, for all intents and purposes, only used in one way, as an object marker, and you will have no problems just pronouncing it 'o' all the time, you don't need to remember any special rules.

### 助詞 joshin particles

- は wa - topic (as for), contrast
- が ga - specify (subject), unknown subject, new information
- を o - object, comes between an object and a verb to indicate an action. This is called the direct object marker. 
- に ni - to; location in/at which sth. exist; specific time
- へ e - to, towards, direction
- で de - by means of; location in/at which the action occurs/is done; group


### More About と、や、の[!](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/ja/how-to-use-japanese-particles-%E3%81%A8-to-%E3%82%84-ya-and-%E3%81%AE-no/)

**Introducing と**

と (to) can be expressed or used in four ways. It can be used for making a list, asking a question, or to express performing an action with another person. Furthermore, と (to) can quote something a person said, as well as one’s own thoughts.

**To make a list**

The Japanese particle と (to) is generally used to express “and” when wanting to list two or more objects. In addition, と (to) can also be used after a certain person’s name, in order to indicate that you were with that certain person.

Example

> 卵と牛乳を買いました。
> Tamago to gyunyu o kaimashita. 
> I bought eggs and milk.

> 友達と夕食を食べました。
> Tomodachi to yuushoku o tabemashita.
> I ate dinner with my friend.

**To show a question**

The Japanese particle と (to) can also be used to explain or show that the sentence before it, is a quotation. In some cases, this is a quotation that is usually used like quotations in English ( E.g. he said…”, she said…). In other cases, this is a “quotation” of someone or a certain person’s thoughts (e.g. I think that…). In addition, it can also be a poetic or metaphorical “quotation” of something that is not able to feel things.
By adding the Japanese [particle](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/summary-9-most-frequently-used-japanese-particles-perfect-guide/) と (to), a sentence can become a quotation even if no [verb](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/summaryjapanese-verb-conjugation-perfect-guide/) for “said” or “thought” is utilized.

Example

```
私は「うそだ」と言っていました。
Watashi wa “uso da” to itte imashita.
I said, “it’s a lie.”
私は「うそだ」と思いました。
Watashi wa “uso da” to omoimashita.
I thought, “it’s a lie.”
私は「うそだ」と笑いました。
Watashi wa “uso da” to waraimashita.
“It’s a lie,” I laughed.
私は「うそだ」と分かっていました。
Watashi wa “uso da” to wakatte imashita.
I understood that it was a lie.
```

Note that, when the Japanese particle と (to) is used in a quotation-style sentence, whatever that is being quoted should be in short form. In addition, the だ (da) [the short form of です (desu)] ending should be included, if the last word of the quote is a noun or a *na-[adjective](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/category/japanese-language/japanese-adjectives/).

*na-[adjective](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/category/japanese-language/japanese-adjectives/): [Conjugation](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/japanese-verb-conjugation-chart) is same as a noun.

**To turn sound symbolic words into adverbs**

When the Japanese [particle](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/summary-9-most-frequently-used-japanese-particles-perfect-guide/) と (to) is placed at the end of a sound symbolic word, it can turn that sound symbolic word into an ad[verb](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/summaryjapanese-verb-conjugation-perfect-guide/).
For example, “バタン (batan)” is the sound of something shutting or closing with a bang. If the Japanese [particle](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/summary-9-most-frequently-used-japanese-particles-perfect-guide/) と (to) is added to the end of “バタン (batan)” it can then be used with a [verb](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/summaryjapanese-verb-conjugation-perfect-guide/).

Example

```
彼女は窓をバタンと閉めました。
Kanojyo wa mado o batan to shimemashita.
She shut the window with a bang.
花瓶がガシャンと割れた。
Kabin ga gashan to wareta.
The vase broke with a crash.
```

**To mean if/when**

The Japanese [particle](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/summary-9-most-frequently-used-japanese-particles-perfect-guide/) と (to) can also be used to be defined as “if” or “when.” The Japanese language has many patterns for making conditional sentences. For example, if the Japanese [particle](https://bondlingo.tv/blog/summary-9-most-frequently-used-japanese-particles-perfect-guide/) と (to) is used for conditional sentences, the result will always occur when the condition occurs.

Example

```
公園に行くと、いつも落ち着きます。
Kouen ni iku to, itsumo ochitsuki masu.
When I go to the park, I always feel calm.
その花をかぐと、くしゃみが止まらない。
Sono hana o kagu to, kushami ga tomaranai.
If I smell that flower, I can not stop sneezing.
```

---

**Introducing や**

The Japanese particle や (ya) is similar to と (to), in which it links two or more items in a list. The key difference is that the や (ya) is vaguer than と (to). While the Japanese particle と (to) implies that a list is concise or complete, や (ya) implies that the list may be incomplete, or that the things listed could perhaps be examples.

Example

```
パンや焼き菓子をよく作ります。
Pan ya yakigashi o yoku tsukurimasu.
I often make bread and baked sweets.
```

---

**Introducing の**

The Japanese particle の (no) is one of the most versatile particles in the Japanese grammar. Both informal and semi-formal Japanese, の (no) is used primarily to express a ownership. In informal Japanese, の (no) can also be placed at the end of a sentence to express a question or an explanation.

Example

```
私の犬は小さくて白いです。
Watashi no inu wa chiisakute shiroi desu
My dog is small and white. 
いつ京都に行くの？
Itsu Kyoto ni iku no?
When will you go to Kyoto?
今、雨が降っているの。
Ima, ame ga futte iru no.
It’s raining outside right now. 
```

The last sentence implies that you are telling or explaining to the listener something that they did not already know.
