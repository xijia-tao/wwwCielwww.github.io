This is where I take notes when learning Japanese. Sources are acknowledged in the beginning.

## Day 1^

- Japanese is a 'mora-timed' language; syllables are pronounced equally.
- Japanese characters can represent a vowel, a consonant and a vowel or a single consonant sound.
- Word order: subject, object, verb, or SOV
- topic-prominent language
  - topic is the focus; usually omits the subject
  - create basic sentences; object + verb
- 3 different scripts used to write Japanese
  - Hiragana ひらがな is used to write functional words and particles.
  - Katakana カタカナ is used to write foreign words and names.
  - Kanji 漢字 is used to write native Japanese words, or words of Chinese origin.

## Day 2^

> Note: for writing Japanese on a PC, you can download Google Japanese IME, which can be more convenient than the Windows native IME. You can shift between Japanese and English with `Alt` + `~`.

**ありがとう** arigato1 - thank you

**すみません** sumimasen - I'm sorry/excuse me

**どこですか** - where is ...? Put place name before the phrase, e.g. 駅はどこですか？ホテルはどこですか？コンビニどこですか？

> Why is は (ha) sometimes read as わ (wa)? 
> 
> は is only pronounced as wa when being used as topic marking particle or the end of a phrase, e.g. こんばんは (good evening), こんにちは (hello). But for instance, はる (春) is pronounced as haru.

The timing of each syllable is important. Syllables pronouncing with different time can have different meanings, e.g. おばあさん (grandma) and おばさん (aunt). To achieve the necessary pause, use a pause (つ) between syllables, e.g. きつて (stamp) and きて (please come).

Pitch accent (intonation) can also lead to words with different meanings, e.g. は2し1 (chopsticks) and 橋 (ha1shi2, bridge).

## Day 3

Past tense: ました、ませんでした

Present/future tense: ます、ません

を can be used after the subject as a word proceeding quantitative term, e.g. りんごを２つ食べます

be going to: に行きます

(not) a lot should be put before the walk, e.g. 彼女はあまり踊りません

Verbs (時々、いつも、よく) representing frequencies need not は、お、を after them when put in front of a sentence, e.g. 私はいつもスポーツが大好きです。私はいつも彼を愛します (strange, the particles after `sports` and `him` are different, should investigate later, [video](https://youtu.be/UaI7UpOl-Xk) to-watch on Japanese particles)

は indicates the relationship with the subject, while が somehow decorates the subject.

[x]から: from [x] 　[x]まで: to [x]

どれくらいかかりますか？: how long will it take?

駅からホテルまで車で五分くらいかかります: it takes about 5 minutes to go from the train station to the hotel by car.

### Negative い-Adjectives*

When い-adjectives are switched from positive to negative, they undergo a spelling change. The characteristic い-ending switches to a く、and the phrase meaning "not" is added to the end. The final result is an ending such as くないです。See the example below.

| Sentence         | Translation                |
|:---------------- |:-------------------------- |
| これはおいしいです。       | This is delicious.         |
| これは**おいしくないです**。 | This is **not delicious**. |

Just like with positive い-adjectives, all negative い-adjectives can drop the です ending in casual speech.

| Sentence       | Translation                |
|:-------------- |:-------------------------- |
| これは**おいしくない**。 | This is **not delicious**. |

To make the speech more formal, one can change the ending from くないです to くありません。

| Sentence          | Translation                |
|:----------------- |:-------------------------- |
| これは**おいしくありません**。 | This is **not delicious**. |

近くも遠くもないです: it is neither near nor far.

## Day 4

### Difference between これ、それ、あれ

- for objects in the vicinity: これ
- for objects unknown to the audience: それ
- else: あれ

### Wearing Clothing*

Japanese has many translations for the English words "to wear" or "to put on," depending on where on the body the clothes are worn. Below are some examples taught in this lesson.

| Japanese   | Notes                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 着ます・きます    | **wear**, on the whole body or upper body |
| 被ります・かぶります | **wear**, on the head                     |
| 履きます・はきます  | **wear**, on the lower body               |

### Together!*

In Japanese, there are different ways to ask someone to do something with you. Your verb ending can subtly change the nature of your request or suggestion.

| Verb Ending | Meaning in English                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ~ませんか       | "Would you like to...?" / "Do you want to...?" |
| ~ましょう       | "Let's..."                                     |
| ~ましょうか？     | "Shall we...?" / "Should we...?"               |

| Japanese         | English                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| プールで泳ぎ**ませんか**？  | **Would you like to** swim at the pool? |
| プールで泳ぎ**ましょう**。  | **Let's** swim at the pool.             |
| プールで泳ぎ**ましょうか**？ | **Shall we** swim at the pool?          |

#### Weeks and Months

Japanese has specific words for ideas like "last week," "next week" and "this week." There is even a word for "the week after next"! Maybe you'll notice a pattern with how these words are formed!

| Word | Reading | Meaning    |
| ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| 今月   | こんげつ    | this month |
| 来月   | らいげつ    | next month |
| 先月   | せんげつ    | last month |

| Word | Reading | Meaning             |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------- |
| 今週   | こんしゅう   | this week           |
| 来週   | らいしゅう   | next week           |
| 先週   | せんしゅう   | last week           |
| 再来週  | さらいしゅう  | the week after next |

#### Playing an Instrument

Japanese uses different verbs to talk about playing different kinds of musical instruments. In this skill, you will encounter the verb used for playing a string instrument - **弾きます** (ひきます). Don't forget that the piano is included as a string instrument!

| Japanese      | English                |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| ピアノを**弾きます**。 | I **play** the piano.  |
| ギターを**弾きます**。 | I **play** the guitar. |
